============
Downstream analysis of mcBPPS/omcBPPS sequence comparison results

pttrn2pdb.py: maps residue patterns identified from mcBPPS/omcBPPS onto PDB structures and outputs a PyMol script (.pml).

annotate_hpt.py: analyzes sequence partitions output from mcBPPS/omcBPPS and annotates each partition in an hpt file with the # of sequence hits to families in a MAPGAPS profile.
