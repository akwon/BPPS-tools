### Downstream analysis of mcBPPS/omcBPPS sequence comparison results.

___pttrn2pdb.py:___ maps residue patterns identified from mcBPPS/omcBPPS onto PDB structures and outputs a PyMol script (.pml).

___annotate_hpt.py:___ analyzes sequence partitions output from mcBPPS/omcBPPS and annotates each partition in an hpt file with the # of sequence hits to families in a MAPGAPS profile.

___mcbpps2annt_tsv.py:___ outputs residue pattern data from a .lpr file as a .tsv file
